        <p>Yes - you can browse Skyscanner in over 150 currencies.</p>
        <p>If you're on our main desktop website, you can change the currency by clicking on the country flag in the top
          menu of the screen and selecting your chosen currency from the drop-down list.</p>
        <p>To change currency on our mobile website, tap then tap the country flag and choose your preferred
          currency.</p>
        <p>To do this on the app select then selectand choose your currency from there.</p>
        <p>In some cases when linking through to the travel provider’s site, they might display the price in a different
          currency. This can usually be changed on their site, but if you do end up buying in a different currency, we
          recommend checking with your bank to see what exchange rate they will apply before making your booking.</p>
